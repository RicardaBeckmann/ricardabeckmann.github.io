abstract = {Accurate cosmology from upcoming weak lensing surveys relies on knowledge of the total matter power spectrum at percent level at scales {\$}k {\textless} 10{\$} {\$}h{\$}/Mpc, for which modelling the impact of baryonic physics is crucial. We compare measurements of the total matter power spectrum from the Horizon cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: a dark matter-only run, one with full baryonic physics, and another lacking Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback. Baryons cause a suppression of power at {\$}k\backslashsimeq 10{\$} {\$}h/{\$}Mpc of {\$}{\textless}15\backslash{\%}{\$} at {\$}z=0{\$}, and an enhancement of a factor of a few at smaller scales due to the more efficient cooling and star formation. The results are sensitive to the presence of the highest mass haloes in the simulation and the distribution of dark matter is also impacted up to a few percent. The redshift evolution of the effect is non-monotonic throughout {\$}z=0-5{\$} due to an interplay between AGN feedback and gas pressure, and the growth of structure. We investigate the effectiveness of the "baryonic correction model" proposed by Schneider {\&} Teyssier (2015) in describing our results. We require a different redshift evolution and propose an alternative fitting function with {\$}4{\$} free parameters that reproduces our results within {\$}5\backslash{\%}{\$}. Compared to other simulations, we find the impact of baryonic processes on the total matter power spectrum to be smaller at {\$}z=0{\$}. Nevertheless, our results also suggest that AGN feedback is not strong enough in the simulation. Total matter power spectra from the Horizon simulations are made publicly available at https://www.horizon-simulation.org/catalogues.html.},

abstract = {The observed massive end of the local galaxy stellar mass function is steeper than its predicted dark matter (DM) halo counterpart in the standard {\$}\backslashLambda {\$}CDM paradigm. We investigate how active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can account for such a reduction in the stellar content of massive galaxies, through an influence on the gas content of their interstellar (ISM) and circum-galactic medium (CGM). We isolate the impact of AGNs by comparing two simulations from the HORIZON suite, which are identical except that one includes super massive black holes (SMBH) and related feedback. This allows us to cross-identify individual galaxies between these simulations and quantify the effect of AGN feedback on their properties, such as stellar mass and gas outflows. We find that the most massive galaxies ({\$} \backslashrm M{\_}{\{}*{\}} \backslashgeq 3 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} M{\_}\backslashodot {\$}) are quenched to the extent that their stellar masses decrease by about 80{\%} at {\$}z=0{\$}. More generally, SMBHs affect their host halo through a combination of outflows that reduce their baryonic mass, particularly for galaxies in the mass range {\$} \backslashrm 10{\^{}}9 M{\_}\backslashodot \backslashleq M{\_}{\{}*{\}} \backslashleq 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} M{\_}\backslashodot {\$}, and a disruption of central gas inflows, which limits in-situ star formation, particularly massive galaxies with {\$} \backslashrm M{\_}{\{}*{\}} \backslashapprox10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} M{\_}\backslashodot {\$}. As a result of these processes, net gas inflows onto massive galaxies drop by up to 70{\%}. Finally, we measure a redshift evolution in the stellar mass ratio of twin galaxies with and without AGN feedback, with galaxies of a given stellar mass showing stronger signs of quenching earlier on. This evolution is driven by a progressive flattening of the {\$}\backslashrm M{\_}{\{}SMBH{\}}-M{\_}* {\$} relation for galaxies with {\$}\backslashrm M{\_}{\{}*{\}} \backslashleq 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}} M{\_}\backslashodot {\$} as redshift decreases, which translates into smaller SBMHs being harboured by galaxies of any fixed stellar mass, and indicates stronger AGN feedback at higher redshift.},

@article{Beckmann2013a,
abstract = {This paper investigates how a bi-material strip, modelled using bond-based peridynamics implemented into the finite element (FE) code Abaqus/Standard, using truss elements, delaminates when subjected to regular uniform temperature changes. It has been found that for both heating and cooling, a crack grows inwards along the interface, which separates the two layers completely. In both cases, microcracks also form perpendicular to the interface, which adapt to loads by either arresting or curving. The crack patterns appear unaffected by mesh coarseness in a ??-convergence test, except when cracks merge due to lack of resolution. However, changing the length of the implicit timestep used, and therefore the induced thermal strain per step, strongly affects the number and distribution of microcracks, which vanish completely for very small timesteps. A simulated thermal shock yielded more evenly spaced, longer microcracks due to the stresses built up during the thermal shock. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},
