										<h2 class="major">Profile</h2>
										<p>I am a Postdoc at the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris, working on simulations of the origin and impact of supermassive black holes. During my PhD with Adrianne Slyz and Julien Devrient at the University of Oxford, my research focused particularly on the progenitors of the first supermassive black holes at redshift z>6, and the impact of active galactic nuclei feedback on galaxy evolution across cosmic history. In my current role, I continue this line of research and am also working on the origin of cold gas in galaxy clusters.

									<h2 class="major">Research</h2>
									<p>My research focuses on hydrodynamical simulations of supermassive black holes in a variety of different contexts, from large scale cosmological simulations, via simulations of isolated galaxies or galaxy clusters, to idealised black hole accretion simulations. I am interested in the origin and evolution of supermassive black hole across cosmic time, and the impact of their feedback on their host galaxy. A few of my papers and projects are highlighted in more detail below.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Zooming in on the first black holes </h3>
											<p>Observed with masses in excess of a billion solar masses, at a time when the universe was only about a billion years old, the origin of the first supermassive black holes remains an unsolved question today. In the face of few observations from this era, simulations provide one tool to study the origin of these black holes. However, simulating the immediate black hole environment, without loosing the galactic and cosmological context, remains a huge computational challenge. I have worked extensively on extending the range of scales covered in a single simulation, to allow a detailed study of black hole evolution in a the context of their rapidly changing environment in the early universe.  </p>

											<h3 class="major">Zooming in on black hole accretion</h3>

											<p> Many of the most popular current sub-grid algorithms, designed to include black hole physics on scales too small to be resolved in the simulation, date from an era before the recent improvements in resolution. To avoid introducing numerical artifacts when reaching new physical regimes, such as resolving the black hole gravitaitonal radius of influence with the black hole zoom project, requires these "tried and tested" methods to be carefully re-evaluated for their applicability in the new regime. In this paper, I conducted a numerical study of both the much-used Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion algorithm, and the unresolved dynamical friction due to gas, in the case when the gravitational potential of the black hole is well resovled. </p>

											<h3 class="major">The origin of cold gas filaments in clusters</h3>
											<p>Observations of nearby cluster, particuarly of Perseus, show extended cold gas filaments around the brightest cluster galaxy. Several kpc long but only several tens of pc wide, these origin of these filaments is still under discussion. The turbulence induced by the jet of the central active galactic nucleus is thought to play an important role. This project is part of the <a href="https://vm-wordpress-lerma01.obspm.fr/lyrics/"> LYRICS </a> collaboration. </p>

I have given more than 20 outreach talks, to audiences ranging from primary school children to adults. My particular speciality is of course black holes but I am happy to speak about many different topics.  If you are interested in me giving a talk at your institution, school or community, send me an email.
