      <p> My name is Ricarda Beckmann and I am an astrophysics PhD student at the university of Oxford. I study the growth of supermassive black holes in the very early universe, by way of high-resolution simulations produced using RAMSES. </p>

      <h3> My research </h3>
        <p>  The further out we look in space, the further back we look in time. Some of our earliest observations show superbright objects called quasars, which we believe are early galaxies hosting supermassive black holes in their center. These supermassive black holes have masses of over a billion solar masses. That's 1 000 000 000 times as heavy as the sun. The black holes we see forming around us today are very small in comparison, only about as heavy as the sun itself. At the time when these objects existed, the universe was only about a billion years old. I am trying to answer the question of how these objects became so massive in such a "short" period of time. 
To study this, I simulate a part of the universe and as much physics inside it as I can think of:
	<ul>
	  <li> Gas </li>
	  <li> Heating and cooling </li>
	  <li> Star formation</li>
	  <li> Black hole formation</li>
	   <li> Stars dying </li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h5> My code </h5>
        <p> I work with the hydrodynamic AMR code called <a href="https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses">RAMSES</a>, and have been developing it actively since I first got my hands on it.  </p>

	<h5> My first paper </h5>
	<p> I am really proud of <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2013.05.001"  my first paper </a>. It has 3 citations! I originally wrote it while working as a summer intern at the Material science department at Imperial college London.  </p>
